im super drunk waiting for a game of battlefield 4 to begin. funny how your english writing is near perfect (however, im telling my hands to backspace a bagillion times). im having a hard time focusing on targets. im REALLY trying, but they keep killing me. going back in...


btw, drinking feels pretty good. I feel like socializing, but im the only on awake. cutie pie is asleep... :)

we lost...but i killed one guy. wierd, i have a very hard time focusing on anyone. i want to relax...so badly that i refuse to focus 100%. relaxation is my primary goal right now with this alcohol infusion (wierd i picked that word...). anywho, next round is loading.

getting warm, going to turn off the heater. (Warming was too strang of a word...)

thinking of another drink in 20-30 minutes.

trying to avoid enemy. wish i had a microphone. very hard. hard to pinpiont oises.

just on floor. keep eyes closed. lifted myself up. feel suuuper relaxed. do whatever feels right.

i can imagine, being sober, nothing seems much far from the norm, but it is very relaxing to go whatever relaxing.

EXTREMELY HARD TO KILL. If you want to kill anyone, do not drink...at least as heavy as tonight..


btw, get craig a safety razor/blades.

new game. trying to sober up...but not working too well. feeling warming/relaxed.


....


back in!
